Most CMS (Content management system) requires follow up feature which allow manager follows their data easily. The good database design will minumum code/tables. In this topic, I'm going to share about my database design for followup feature.


### Problem

A CMS Website manages the posts by category, the posts are created by the user. The Website has some admin/mod users who are able to approve/edit/delete the posts.
